	/// This reduces the overall registration time, and thus the server 
	/// application startup time, by making a single call to the SCM, no 
	/// matter how many CLSIDs are registered for the server. Another 
	/// advantage is that if the server has multiple apartments with 
	/// different CLSIDs registered in different apartments, or is a free-
	/// threaded server, no activation requests will come in until the server 
	/// calls CoResumeClassObjects. This gives the server a chance to 
	/// register all of its CLSIDs and get properly set up before having to 
	/// deal with activation requests, and possibly shutdown requests.
